# Euclidean-to-Horospherical Optimization

Reference MATLAB implementations of the primal–dual interior-point method and
the ellipsoid method for linear optimization, applying ideas from 'Horospherically Convex Optimization on Hadamard Manifolds Part I: Analysis and Algorithms' by Christopher Criscitiello and Jungbin Kim.

These Euclidean baselines serve as a foundation for ongoing work on extending
classical optimization algorithms to horospherically convex problems
on curved (Hadamard) spaces.
